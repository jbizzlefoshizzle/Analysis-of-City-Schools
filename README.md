## Analysis of City Schools

![Education](Images/education.jpg)

This project concerns the education sector.
Assisting the Chief Data Scientist for this city's school district, I needed to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

I was asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results.
Given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend,
my responsibility was to aggregate the data to and showcase trends in school performance.

Your final report includes each of the following:
